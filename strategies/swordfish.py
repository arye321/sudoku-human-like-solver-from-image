class SwordfishStrategy(Strategy):
    """
    Swordfish Strategy.
    
    This strategy identifies a pattern where a candidate appears exactly 2 or 3 times in each of three different rows,
    and these candidates are aligned in exactly three columns. When found, the candidate can be eliminated from
    other cells in those columns.
    
    The same pattern can also be found with columns and rows reversed.
    
    The strategy works by:
    1. Finding rows where a candidate appears exactly 2 or 3 times
    2. Looking for triplets of such rows where the candidate appears in exactly three columns
    3. Eliminating the candidate from other cells in those columns
    
    Example:
        If candidate 5 appears:
        - In row 1 at columns 2, 4, and 7
        - In row 5 at columns 2 and 4
        - In row 8 at columns 4 and 7
        Then:
        - Cells (1,2), (1,4), (1,7), (5,2), (5,4), (8,4), (8,7) form a Swordfish pattern
        - Candidate 5 can be eliminated from all other cells in columns 2, 4, and 7
