class XWingStrategy(Strategy):
    """
    X-Wing Strategy.
    
    This strategy identifies a pattern where a candidate appears exactly twice in each of two different rows,
    and these candidates are aligned in the same columns. When found, the candidate can be eliminated from
    other cells in those columns.
    
    The same pattern can also be found with columns and rows reversed.
    
    The strategy works by:
    1. Finding rows where a candidate appears exactly twice
    2. Looking for pairs of such rows where the candidate appears in the same columns
    3. Eliminating the candidate from other cells in those columns
    
    Example:
        If candidate 5 appears exactly twice in row 1 (at columns 2 and 7) and
        candidate 5 also appears exactly twice in row 6 (at columns 2 and 7), then:
        - Cells (1,2), (1,7), (6,2), and (6,7) form an X-Wing pattern
        - Candidate 5 can be eliminated from all other cells in columns 2 and 7
