    """
    Pointing Pairs Strategy.
    
    This strategy identifies when a candidate in a box appears only in cells that
    share a common row or column. When found, that candidate can be eliminated from
    other cells in that row/column outside the box.
    
    The strategy works by:
    1. Finding candidates in a box that only appear in two or three cells
    2. Checking if these cells share the same row or column
    3. Eliminating the candidate from other cells in that row/column outside the box
    
    Example:
        If in a box, the number 4 appears as a candidate only in two cells that share
        the same row, then:
        - 4 must be in one of those cells in that box
        - 4 can be eliminated from all other cells in that row outside the box
